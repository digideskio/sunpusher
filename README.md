# Sunpusher

I'm learning Go. This pulls data from [Forecast.io][1] and pushes to [Pushbullet][2].

I run it as a cronjob to get a weather update on my devices.

If you see something wrong or have a suggestion on how it could be done better I'm learning! 

# Setup

Copy `config.json.template` into place

    cp config.json.template

Replace the values in the file with your own.
